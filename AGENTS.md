# Repository instructions

## Current phase

Scaffold only as of 2026-09-26. Until the user requests implementation, limit
changes to documentation, directory placeholders, and repository hygiene. Do not
add executable stubs, dependency installations, services, model downloads,
backend code, or runtime integration.

## Working rules

- Read README.md and docs/SCAFFOLD.md before changing the structure.
- Treat directory ownership as provisional; it does not freeze an API or language.
- Preserve existing architecture and research documents.
- Record unresolved design choices explicitly rather than inventing contracts.
- Keep secrets, model weights, generated outputs, and local runtime state out of Git.
- Verify documentation links and inspect git diff --check for scaffold changes.
- Do not report empty test directories as passing runtime tests.

## Observatory boundary

Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/INTEGRATION.md, and docs/SECURITY_PRIVACY.md.
Preserve the existing protocol schema and design tokens. Producer instrumentation
belongs in Runtime/Inference; Observatory consumes telemetry and owns no execution
state. Existing technology preferences remain proposals to validate.
